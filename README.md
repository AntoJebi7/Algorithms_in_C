# Algorithms_in_C
Collection of C algorithms for various data structures and problem-solving techniques, including sorting, searching, and graph algorithms. Designed for educational purposes and practical implementation.

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of algorithms implemented in C, covering a wide range of fundamental data structures and algorithmic techniques. Designed to facilitate learning and practical application, this repository includes implementations for classic algorithms such as sorting (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort), searching (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search), and advanced topics like graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's Shortest Path, Depth-First Search). Each algorithm is crafted with educational clarity and practical efficiency in mind, accompanied by detailed comments and explanations to aid in understanding. Whether you're a student looking to grasp core concepts or a developer seeking to integrate efficient algorithms into your projects, this repository provides a solid foundation. Contributions and improvements are welcome to enhance the utility and breadth of the algorithms included.
